# P422 Vinyl Viewer Project

**A proposal for an application that will store and display a user's vinyl record collection** 

Vinyl Viewer will provide the user with an interface where they can enter information about vinyl records in their collection. Ideally, I would like to make the application interface with the RecordSetter app that my team completed in C346. That would make it possible for a user to snap a picture of the album cover, have the information provided by web services, and then add it to a database and have multiple custom views available.

Some of the information that will be stored includes:

* Artist Name
* Album Title
* Track Listing
* Release Version
* A Link to the Album Art
* User Assigned Album Rating

This information could be entered directly into the angular application, or as mentioned, imported from the RecordSetter app.

The user can then select from a number of custom views that include:

* Albums By Artist
* Albums By Genre
* Albums Grouped By Keyword Search
* Albums Grouped By Rating

This application will hopefully provide a clean and helpful interface for users with large collections of vinyl records. If it can interface with the RecordSetter app, then the effort the user must exert is minimal to have a useful populated database.
